Xenopus laevis Egg Counting using Deep Learning (StarDist)
===========================================================

Overview
--------
This project uses deep learning to automatically count frog eggs (Xenopus laevis) in images.
Developed through LSUâ€™s Capstone Course in partnership with the Aquatic Germplasm and Genetic 
Resources Center (AGGRC), this tool replaces manual counting with an efficient, high-accuracy 
instance segmentation model using StarDist.

GUI Tool Repository: https://github.com/LSU-Devision/GUI

Key Features
------------
- Instance segmentation using StarDist (U-Net backbone)
- Trained and evaluated on 180+ annotated frog egg images
- Achieved 93% accuracy (120 training images, 150 epochs)
- Alternate model using only 114 annotated images with rotation-based augmentation

Folder Structure
----------------
- data/         : Input images and image masks
- models/       : Trained model weights
- scripts/      : Python scripts for training and testing
- figures/      : Graphs and visualizations of model performance

Installation
------------
1. Requires Python 3.8 or higher
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. For the GUI (hosted separately), visit:  
   https://github.com/LSU-Devision/GUI  
   and follow its instructions to run the application.

How to Annotate Images
----------------------
- Use Fiji (ImageJ v1.54) with the Labkit plugin
- Manually outline each egg using the pencil tool
- Save the resulting mask as a .tif file


Dependencies
------------
- StarDist 0.8.5
- TensorFlow 2.10.0
- NumPy, SciPy, Pillow, Matplotlib
- scikit-learn, openpyxl, tkinter-tooltip
- ImageJ (Fiji) with Labkit plugin for annotation

Credits
-------
Developed by LSU students and faculty as part of the Math Capstone course.
Supervisors: Prof. Peter R Wolenski (Mathematics) and Dr. Yue Liu (AGGRC)
